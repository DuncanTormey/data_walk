Depletion of its N-terminus results in a hypomorphic version and early embryonic lethality has been reported in mice.

       "68   Previously, we have shown that treatment with the splicing inhibitor, isoginkgetin, has additional effects to splicing inhibition.  We've found that upstream antisense reads (PROMPTs) are more prevalent, as well as elongations in short genes and 5' accumulations in longer genes.  Previous westerns have shown that, although there is a decrease in overall pol II (using N20), there is a slight increase in ser5 phosphorylation in isoginkgetin treated Hela cells.
